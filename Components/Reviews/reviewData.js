Nothing is too much trouble and if there are any problems I can call the office, where the staff are very helpful. Also, I always get a call back with reassurance.",

      "For the first time ever I got in care to look after my mum whilst I was away on holiday for ten days. The care my mum received from the two carers was excellent. My mum is disabled, in a wheelchair and profoundly deaf with partial sight and she was treated with care and gentleness (her words) and they were very helpful to what she needed doing. I've worked in the care sector myself so I know how hard and rewarding visiting a client can be so thank you for taking good care of my mum.",

Nothing is ever too much effort for them, and all care is provided to a high standard.
